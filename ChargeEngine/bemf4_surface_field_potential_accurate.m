function Potential = bemf4_surface_field_potential_accurate(c, Center, Area, PC)
%   This function computes CONTINUOUS electric field and the full potential
%   on a surface facet due to charges on ALL OTHER facets including
%   accurate neighbor integrals. Self-terms causing discontinuity may not
%   be included for electric field
%   To obtain the true field/potential, divide the result(s) by eps0;
