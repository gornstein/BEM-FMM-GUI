# BEM-FMM-GUI
### WPI Summer 2022 E1 Term - GUI Design for Professor Makarov

---

### Branches:
- prod: Default branch, ONLY for totally stable, working code. _**Do Not**_ commit directly to this branch.
- dev: Used for testing/developing working code. Is only merged to prod when everything is totally stable.

---

### Updates:
- [x] \(Finalize filesystem structure and naming scheme) 
I will create another post when we finalize the filesystem structure and naming convention, it is almost finished.
- [x] \(Finalize .gitignore) 
I plan on solving the issue of inability to upload large files to Github by utilizing a thorough .gitignore, which I am in the process of creating. It will likely be a whitelist style gitignore instead of blacklist, so that we can make sure we only upload the files we need to share.
- [x] \(After completing above, get Alton to push his code to main and then make branches for everyone to work with) 
For commits and branches, the current plan is to (after finalizing filesystem structure and naming convention and .gitignore) have Alton upload his code to branch main, and then create a separate branch for everyone to push commits to so that we aren't overwriting each other's code. Then, we can periodically merge the branches to main, say after someone completes an assigned task, for example.
- [ ] \(Get everyone on repo and permissions configured) 
Once I get everyone on this repo and setup, we can start delegating tasks and creating timelines.
